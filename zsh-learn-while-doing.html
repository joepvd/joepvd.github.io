    <div class="content">
      <p>What good are advanced and hard to remember features if there is no help available at a fingertip?  Globbing in zsh might be the best thing since sliced bread, but if you don't know the details, you might as well be chewing on a brick.</p>
<p>So, why not organize in such a way so that the details are readily available?  One of the many nice ideas from feh's <a class="reference external" href="http://git.plenz.com/configs/plain/.zsh/zshrc">excellent zsh configuration file</a> does exactly that, but it looked ugly on a too small terminal, and it looks like quite some manual work to format the information in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/.zshrc</span></tt>.  So I made <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/joepvd/zsh-hints">zsh-hints</a>, a small helper program that turns a definition file into helpful hints.</p>
<p>Who can remember all those <a class="reference external" href="http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Expansion.html#Glob-Operators">glob flags</a>?  Imagine wanting to see the Setgid, and world readable files in somewhere here in a subdirectory. Just hit <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;CTRL <span class="pre">X&gt;&lt;g&gt;</span></tt> …</p>
<pre class="code sh literal-block">
% print -l **/*&lt;CTRL X&gt;&lt;g&gt;
</pre>
<p>… and you will be presented with this result:</p>
<pre class="code sh literal-block">
% print -l **/*
/           ▶ directories
F           ▶ non-empty directories <span class="o">(</span>full<span class="o">)</span>
.           ▶ plain files
-           ▶ executable plain files
l<span class="o">[</span>-+<span class="o">]</span>n      ▶ link count
r,w,x       ▶ owner <span class="o">(</span>r<span class="o">)</span>eadable <span class="o">(</span>w<span class="o">)</span>ritable,
              e<span class="o">(</span>x<span class="o">)</span>ecutable files
A,I,E       ▶ group re<span class="o">(</span>A<span class="o">)</span>dable wr<span class="o">(</span>I<span class="o">)</span>table,
              <span class="o">(</span>E<span class="o">)</span>xecutable files

f<span class="o">[</span>+<span class="o">=</span>-<span class="o">]</span>NNN   ▶ files with access rights matching
              +,-,<span class="o">=</span> octal number
<span class="o">{</span>U,G<span class="o">}</span>NNN    ▶ owned by effective <span class="o">(</span>U<span class="o">)</span>ser,<span class="o">(</span>G<span class="o">)</span>roup

<span class="o">{</span>u,g<span class="o">}</span>:name: ▶ owned by user, group name <span class="sb">`</span>name<span class="sb">`</span>
   ...18 hints omitted.
</pre>
<p>A quick glance will help you conclude that <tt class="docutils literal">(.GW)</tt> is what you are looking for.</p>
<p>This example was made on a rather small terminal.  That is why some of the explanations were wrapped, and were displayed with a secondary separator of just a space. It also did not fit in the vertical direction.  An optional message notifying how much you are missing on is displayed.</p>
<p>The key file is really simple to make: It just assumes that the first space separates the key from the explanation. There is no way of putting a space in the key.</p>
<p>All the details of installation and configuration are covered in the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/joepvd/zsh-hints">README</a>. Please let me know if it does or does not work for you.</p>
<p>Enjoy :)</p>
